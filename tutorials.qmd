title: "Other Tutorials"
---

Some of the content that we produce is not as detailed as our full workshops but has a wider scope than the content included in our [Coding Tips](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/best_practices.html) suggestions. This information can broadly be defined as "tutorials" though their depth and scope can vary significantly depending on the topic being tutorialized. As with our [Coding Tips](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/best_practices.html), this page is under constant development so please [post an issue](https://github.com/NCEAS/scicomp.github.io/issues) if you have an idea for a tutorial that you'd like to suggest that we create.
