NCEAS offers an array of helpful computing infrastructure for your group. These resources are purely optional but can be a significant aid to your projects' progression both when you're in-person in Santa Barbara and between those meetings! Our team is ready and willing to explain these in greater detail or help your group build them into your workflow so don't hesitate to reach out!
