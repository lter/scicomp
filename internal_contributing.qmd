While our team is composed of members from different backgrounds, we strive to adhere to a shared set of contributing and style guidelines. This ensures a consistent "feel" of our team's products, regardless of which team member took the lead on a particular task.

Standard convention in GitHub is to house such information in a "CONTRIBUTING.md" file in the top-level of the relevant repository. We have done that in the repository underpinning this website but you can also quickly jump to that file by clicking [here](https://github.com/lter/scicomp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note that these are only required for Scientific Computing team members but you may find some of this guidance helpful even if you're not a part of our team.
