**Pick a title** and **check the "Create a git repository" checkbox.** For your title, short but descriptive titles are most effective. Once that is done, click **"Create Project"** in the bottom right of the window.

After a few seconds, RStudio should refresh with a Quarto document (such documents have the file extension ".qmd") and a "_quarto.yml" file open.

Part of Quarto's central philosophy is that all of the formatting of individual .qmd files in a project is governed by the settings created by a singular .yml file. In an R markdown project some of the global settings are set in .yml but other settings are handled within each .Rmd file. This centralization is a key innovation in streamlining projects and is one reason for Quarto's quick popularity.
