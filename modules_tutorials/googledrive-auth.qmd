In order to connect R with a GoogleDrive, we'll need to authorize `googledrive` to act on our behalf. This only needs to be done once (per computer) so follow along and you'll be building GoogleDrive into your workflows in no time!

First, **install the `googledrive` and `httpuv` R packages**. The `googledrive` package's need is self-evident while the `httpuv` package makes the following steps a little easier than `googledrive` makes it alone. Be sure to load the `googledrive` package after you install it!

```{r load-packages, eval = F}
# Install packages
install.packages(c("googledrive", "httpuv"))

# Load them
library(googledrive)
```

Once you've installed the packages we can begin the authentication in R using the `drive_auth` function in the `googledrive` package.

```{r drive-auth-fxn, eval = F}
googledrive::drive_auth(email = "enter your gmail here!")
```

If this is your *first time* using `googledrive`, `drive_auth` will kick you to a new tab of your browser (see below for a screen grab of that screen) where you can pick which Gmail you'd like to connect to R.

**Click the Gmail you want to use** and you will get a second screen where Google tells you that "Tidyverse API" wants access to your Google Account. This message is followed by three checkboxes, the first two are grayed out but the third is unchecked.

### NOTE
This next bit is vitally important so *carefully* read and follow the next instruction!

In this screen, **you must check the unchecked box** to be able to use the `googledrive` R package. If you do not check this box all attempts to use `googledrive` functions will get an error that says "insufficient permissions".

While granting access to "see, edit, create, and "delete" all of your Google Drive files" sounds like a significant security risk, those powers are actually why you're using the `googledrive` package in the first place! You want to be able to download existing Drive files, change them in R on your computer, and then put them back in Google Drive which is exactly what is meant by "see, edit, create, and delete".

Also, this power *only applies to the computer you're currently working on!* Granting access on your work computer allows **only** that computer to access your Drive files. So don't worry about giving access to your Drive to the whole world, that is protected by the same failsafes that you use when you let your computer remember a password to a website you frequent.

*After* you've checked the authorization box, **scroll down and click the "Continue" button**.

This should result in a plain text page that tells you to close this window and return to R. If you see this message you are ready to use the `googledrive` package!
