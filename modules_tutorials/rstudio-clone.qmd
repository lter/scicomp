Now that you have created a repository, we need to clone it locally so we can create the content we want in RStudio. First, open RStudio and click the **project button** in the top right. If you use RStudio projects already, this will be the name of your current project. If you do not use projects it will say "Project: (None)".

</p>

When you click that button you should see a small menu appear. You should **click "New Project..."** (the topmost option). Note that if you use projects you'll see a list of up to the 10 most recent projects filling out the rest of this menu.

</p>

This will create a pop-up window in front of RStudio where you can decide what kind of project you want to create. Because we're cloning from an existing GitHub repository, **click "Version Control"**.

</p>

In the next window, **choose "Git"**.

</p>

Before we address the next dialog window, go back to the landing page for the GitHub repository you'd like to clone. **Click the "Code" button and _copy the link_**. The "Code" button will likely be either **<span style="color:blue">blue</span>** or **<span style="color:green">green</span>**.

In the example image below we're using a repository that has just been created but the process is the same for repositories that already have work in them.

</p>

Now, return to RStudio and **paste the link that you just copied** into the top field of the new project pop-up menu. You must also **pick a name for your project locally** as well as **deciding where on your computer you'd like the local copies to live**. Feel free to name the project whatever you'd like so that you will be easily able to find it later.

</p>

Once you're happy with your entries to those fields, **Click "Create Project"**. You'll know this has worked when the top right of RStudio has whatever name you entered in the second field of the preceding menu.
