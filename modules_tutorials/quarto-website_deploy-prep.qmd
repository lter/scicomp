To prepare your project for web deployment via GitHub Pages, we have **three** quick steps that we must first complete.

*First*, in the "_quarto.yml" file, **add `output-dir: docs` as a subheading beneath the `project:` heading.** Make sure that the indentation is the same as the `type: website` but the new line can be either above or below that line.

</p>

*Second*, **in the "Terminal" pane run `touch .nojekyll`.** This creates a file called ".nojekyll" that is necessary for hosting your website via GitHub Pages. 

*Third*, **in the "Terminal" pane run `quarto render`.** This processes the template .qmd files you currently have in the repository and prepares them to become actual web pages.

Once you've done these three things you can move on to creating a GitHub repository so that we can take the necessary steps to having GitHub host your website!
