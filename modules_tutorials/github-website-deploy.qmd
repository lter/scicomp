In order to get your new website actually on the web, we'll need to tell GitHub that we want our website to be accessible at a .github.io URL.

To do this, **go to the "Settings" tab** with a gear icon and click it. You may be prompted to re-enter your GitHub password, do so and you can proceed.

In the resulting page, look towards the bottom of the left sidebar of settings categories and **click the "Pages" option.** This is at the very bottom of the sidebar in the screen capture below but is towards the middle of all of the settings categories Github offers you.

Scroll down to the middle of this page and where it says "Branch" **click the dropdown menu that says "None" by default.**

**Select "main"** from the dropdown.

</p>

This opens up a new dropdown menu where you can select which folder in your repository contains your website's content (it defaults to "/ (root)"). Because we specified `output-dir: docs` in the .yml file earlier we can **select "/docs" from the dropdown menu.**

</p>

Once you've told GitHub that you want a website generated from the "docs" folder on the main branch, **click the "Save" button.**

</p>

From this moment your website has begun being deployed by GitHub! You can check the status of the building process by **navigating to the "Actions" tab of your repository.**

**Select the "pages build and deployment workflow"** in the list of workflows on the bottom righthand side of the page.

This **shows you GitHub's building and deployment process as a flowchart.** While it is working on each step there will be an **<span style="color:orange">amber</span>** circle next to the name of that sub-task. When a sub-task is completed, the **<span style="color:orange">amber</span>** circle becomes a **<span style="color:green">green</span>** circle with a check mark.

When the three steps are complete the **<span style="color:orange">amber</span>** clock symbol next to the "pages build and deployment" action will turn into a larger **<span style="color:green">green</span>** circle with a check mark. This is GitHub's way of telling you that your website is live and accessible to anyone on the internet.

You can now visit your website by visiting its dedicated URL. **This URL can be found by returning to the "Settings" tab and then scrolling through the sidebar to the "Pages" section.**

Alternately, the website for your repository always uses the following composition: *https://**<span style="color:blue">repository owner</span>**.github.io/**<span style="color:purple">repository name</span>**/*

If we visit that link, we can see that our website is live!

#### GitHub Housekeeping

We recommend a quick housekeeping step now to make it easier to find this URL in the future. **Copy the URL from the Pages setting area and return to the "Code" tab of the repository**.

Once there, **click the small gear icon to the right of the "About" header.**

<img src="images/tutorial_github-modules/github-tidy-1.png" width = "100%" />

In the resulting window, **paste the copied URL into the "Website" field.** Once you've pasted it in, **click the** **<span style="color:green">green</span>** **"Save changes" button.**

<p align="center">
<img src="images/tutorial_github-modules/github-tidy-2.png" width = "60%" />
</p>

This places the link to your deployed website in an intuitive, easy-to-find location both for interested third parties and yourself in the future.
