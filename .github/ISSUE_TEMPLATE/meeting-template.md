## Summary

This issue is meant primarily to document the support tasks requested and/or performed during a group's meeting. Given the fast-paced nature of these meetings, comments below may be incomplete or sporadic but are still hopefully better than nothing.

## Starting Tasks

- [ ] Record support tasks / notes for future as comments below
- [ ] Add meeting to LNO's [group activity GoogleSheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bn7i0DtkZzUgTGasSkoU9-KsZ1wq8JuPMb9qI8Rizu0/edit?gid=476302242#gid=476302242)
