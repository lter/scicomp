## What We Do

The Scientific Computing team is a small (but mighty!) team of data scientists supporting synthesis working groups funded by the Long Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) Network Office. Participation in these groups is open to scientists from within and outside of the LTER Network. We provide modern technological infrastructure to support analytical, computing, or network-based needs for these synthesis working groups.

We are housed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)). **Our goal is to support and promote an open and reproducible approach to synthesis science**. We do so by providing on-demand training, advising, and direct code/data support. In addition to the support during in-person meetings at NCEAS, our team is available in-between visits to discuss and advise on data science and scientific programming tasks, such as:

- Structuring and integrating heterogeneous datasets
- Writing code to wrangle, analyze, model, or visualize the data your group has already collected
- Designing workflows, scripting best practices for reproducible science, and reviewing code
- Helping you get set up on NCEAS' server and scale your analysis
- Preserving and promoting your products on the internet
    - Including everything from derived datasets and terminological glossaries/vocabularies to scripts, model codes, and interactive "web applications"
- Offering workshops on new skills or programs (such as Git/GitHub)

Depending on your team's preferences, we can operate on a spectrum of independence ranging from complete self-sufficiency after initial definition of task scope to coding together with your team.

Contact [our team](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/staff.html) with your requests at scicomp \[at\] nceas.ucsb.edu

## Navigating this Website

### If you're a working group member...

For members of our working groups, this website is a centralized hub of resources designed to help you get familiar with the way our team works and what we offer. The pages under the **Working Group Onboarding** tab contain materials that will facilitate collaboration between our team and your group! 

[**Team Coding**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/onboard-scaffold_team_coding.html) contains 5 essential recommendations to keep in mind while coding collaboratively. 

Visit [**Working Together**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/onboard-scaffold_services.html) for more details on the types of tasks we can help with. 

For information on the modern technological infrastructure that NCEAS provides, check out [**NCEAS Infrastructure**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/onboard-scaffold_infrastructure.html).

To see a list of the supported, collaborative tools that our team uses, visit [**Suggested Tools**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/onboard-scaffold_suggested-tools.html).

For other miscellaneous resources, see [**Other Resources**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/onboard-scaffold_other-materials.html).

We look forward to assisting your group however we can! Please do not hesitate to contact [our team](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/staff.html) for any task requests and questions. 

### For working groups and all our other visitors...

Welcome! Even if you're not a part of a synthesis working group, we hope that you find the various resources on this website helpful! If you're interested in learning more about open, reproducible science, please feel free to take a look at our [**Workshops**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/workshops.html) on GitHub, `tidyverse`, and R Shiny apps! Or peruse our [**Tutorials**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/tutorials.html) and [**Coding Tips**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/best_practices.html) pages for other useful tips in R.
