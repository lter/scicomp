## What We Do

The Scientific Computing team is a small (but mighty!) team of data scientists supporting synthesis working groups funded by the Long Term Ecological Research ([LTER](https://lternet.edu/)) Network Office. Participation in these groups is open to scientists from within and outside of the LTER Network. We provide modern technological infrastructure to support analytical, computing, or network-based needs for these synthesis working groups.

We are housed at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)). **Our goal is to support and promote an open and reproducible approach to synthesis science**. We do so by providing on-demand training, advising, and direct code/data support. In addition to the support during in-person meetings at NCEAS, our team is available in-between visits to discuss and advise on data science and scientific programming tasks, such as:

- Structuring and integrating heterogeneous datasets
- Writing code to wrangle, analyze, model, or visualize the data your group has already collected
- Designing workflows, scripting best practices for reproducible science, and reviewing code
- Helping you get set up on NCEAS' server and scale your analysis
- Preserving and promoting your products on the internet
    - Including everything from derived datasets and terminological glossaries/vocabularies to scripts, model codes, and interactive "web applications"
- Offering workshops on new skills or programs (such as Git/GitHub)

Depending on your team's preferences, we can operate on a spectrum of independence ranging from complete self-sufficiency after initial definition of task scope to coding together with your team.

### Working Group Members

For members of our working groups, this website is a centralized hub of resources designed to help you get familiar with the way our team works and what we offer. The pages under the **Working Group Onboarding** dropdown menu are particularly targeted at facilitating collaboration between your group and our team!

### Other Visitors

Welcome! Even if you're not a part of a working group, we hope that you find the various resources on this website helpful! If you're interested in learning more about open, reproducible science, please feel free to take a look at our [**Workshops**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/workshops.html) pages and [**Coding Tips**](https://lter.github.io/scicomp/best_practices.html) pages for other useful tips in R.
