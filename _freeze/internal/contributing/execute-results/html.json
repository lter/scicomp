This ensures a consistent \"feel\" of our team's products, regardless of which team member took the lead on a particular task.\n\nStandard convention in GitHub is to house such information in a \"CONTRIBUTING.md\" file in the top-level of the relevant repository. We have done that in the repository underpinning this website but you can also quickly jump to that file by clicking [here](https://github.com/lter/scicomp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nNote that these are only required for Scientific Computing team members but you may find some of this guidance helpful even if you're not a part of our team.\n",
