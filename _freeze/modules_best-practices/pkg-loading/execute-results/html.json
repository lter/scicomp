While you could comment-out an `install.packages()` line for every package you need for a given script, we recommend using the R package `librarian` to greatly simplify this process!\n\n`librarian::shelf()` accepts the names of all of the packages--either CRAN or GitHub--installs those that are missing in that particular R session and then attaches all of them. See below for an example:\n\nTo load packages typically you'd have something like the following in your script:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Install packages (if needed)\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\n# devtools::install_github(\"NCEAS/scicomptools\")\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse); library(scicomptools)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWith `librarian::shelf()` however this becomes *much* cleaner! In addition to being fewer lines, using `librarian` also removes the possibility that someone running your code misses one of the packages that your script depends on and then the script breaks for them later on. `librarian::shelf()` automatically detects whether a package is installed, installs it if necessary, and then attaches the package.\n\nIn essence, `librarian::shelf()` wraps `install.packages()`, `devtools::install_github()`, and `library()` into a single, human-readable function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install and load packages!\nlibrarian::shelf(tidyverse, NCEAS/scicomptools)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen using `librarian::shelf()`, package names do not need to be quoted and GitHub packages can be installed without the additional steps of installing the `devtools` package and using `devtools::install_github()` instead of `install.packages()`.\n",
