## Analytical Sprints

For larger tasks, we offer "analytical sprints." If your group requests an analytical sprint, you will get one of our team members working *full time only for your group's tasks for 3-4 weeks!* This can be a great option if your group has many smaller tasks or fewer larger projects that are particularly time-sensitive.

We are excited that these sprints are a part of our "menu" of offerings to you all but please reach out to us to start the conversation before requesting a sprint so that we can make sure we are all on the same page.
