## Tasks

**This level of collaboration is the core of our value to working groups!** When your group identifies a data-related need (e.g., designing an analytical workflow, creating a website, writing an R Shiny app, etc.), you reach out to [our team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/staff.html) and get the conversation started. During that time we will work closely with you to define the scope of the work and get a clear picture of what "success" looks like in this context.

Once the task is appropriately defined, the conversation moves on to how independently you'd like us to work. This varies dramatically between tasks even within a single working group and *there is no single right answer*! For some tasks, we are capable of working completely independently and returning to your team with a finished product in hand for review but we are equally comfortable working closely with you throughout the life-cycle of a task.
