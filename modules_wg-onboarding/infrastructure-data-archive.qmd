## Data Preservation

While we know that you are just getting started, *it is never too early to start thinking about where you are going to store the data your group will collate and synthesize!* NCEAS is committed to practicing and promoting open science, making scientific research and its supporting data and information accessible to all levels of society. Therefore, we recommend that any input data used for your synthesis work be well documented and preserved in a long-term data repository.

It is required to document and preserve any products resulting from working group activities in a long-term data repository, such as the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org/) (EDI) data repository or the NCEAS-supported [KNB Data Repository](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/), which are part of the [Data Observation Network for Earth](https://www.dataone.org/) (DataONE).

We are happy to discuss which of these options might fit your group best though we recognize this discussion can probably be left alone until your group has amassed a substantial amount of data.
