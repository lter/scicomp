## Analytical Servers

Working groups have access to several high-performance computers at NCEAS, which provide advanced analytical, web, and database capabilities that far exceed the capabilities of desktop computers. We are available to set up and instruct you in the use of these Linux/Unix systems for demanding scientific analyses and modeling runs that benefit from lots of memory or storage, or access to multiple CPU’s.

Our [most powerful system](https://help.nceas.ucsb.edu/NCEAS/Computing/high_performance_computing) (pictured) currently offers 384GB of RAM memory, along with 44 cores (CPUs), and several terabytes of fast storage. Several scientific software packages – such as R/RStudio, Python, Matlab, and QGIS – are already installed. Ask us if you need us to install any specific analytical libraries or packages.

**We can also set up shared storage space on our server to facilitate data sharing within your working group.** This is particularly valuable for large files that would take up a significant amount of your group's cloud storage system (e.g., GoogleDrive, Dropbox, etc.)

To request access to the NCEAS analytical server, please coordinate with your PIs and contact us with your request.
