## Version 1.0

This is the first functioning version of the website in this GitHub Organization. Previously the website was hosted in [this Github repository](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/) but we've chosen to migrate it here going forward.

Features include:

- All content from the website's prior location
- Streamlined website structure, content, and navigation
- Clarified difference between "workshops", "trainings", and "tips"
- Created a `_pages_deprecated` directory in GitHub to store pages that are completely deleted for posterity
    - This is as opposed to pages that are absorbed or synthesized into other existing pages
- Consistent alt text for majority of images in website
    - Priority for next release is adding alt text to _all_ images
